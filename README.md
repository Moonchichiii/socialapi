## Project Goals

Social Food Posting is a simple platform for users to share their culinary creations, interact with like-minded individuals, and manage user profiles, posts, likes, and comments. 

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to register an account and log in to access the platform's features.
- As a user, I want to post photos of my dishes and share them with the community.
- As a user, I want to like and comment on posts from other users.
- As a user, I want to update my profile information and manage my posts.

## Kanban Board

- **Development Process:** While working on this project, an agile development approach was followed as much as possible.
- **Development Preparation:** The initial steps involved thorough planning of the website, creating a class diagram for the models, and wireframes for the UI.
- **Feature Tracking & Task Management:** Features were categorized and moved through different columns (Todo, In Progress, Done) as they were worked on and completed.

### Pre-pre checks 
- Python-3.12.3
- Visual Studio Code

### 1. Cloning the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine:
- ![alt text](<testingmd/images/Screenshot 2024-05-01 134745.png>)

- ![alt text](<testingmd/images/Screenshot 2024-05-01 134752.png>)

### Virtual Environment Setup 
- ***Using Windows***

- ***`python -m venv venv`***
- ***`.\venv\Scripts\activate`***

## Install Dependencies

### Install the required packages:

- ***Copy the list above and run this command***
- ***pip install*** - ***copied list from above it will then install all you need*** 

**To add it to a requirements list run the pip freeze -r requirements.txt will create the requirements.txt with all of the installed dependencies.** 

**Then to start the "project"**

- ***django-admin startproject "name of the project folder" don't forget the dot after the project .***

**Test that it runs "python manage.py runserver"**

**Then don't forget to add .gitignore and add the ".env" for the environment variables ( I used Decouple it looks clean in the settings.py )**

### In settings.py 

- ***DEBUG = config('DEBUG', default=False, cast=bool)***

- ***SECRET_KEY = config('SECRET_KEY')***

- ***if DEBUG:***
  -  ***ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['127.0.0.1', 'localhost']***
  -  ***CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS = ['http://localhost:5173']*** **FRONTEND DURING DEVELOPMENT.**
- ***else:***
  - ***ALLOWED_HOSTS = config('ALLOWED_HOSTS').split(',')***
  -  ***CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS = config('CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS').split(',')***

### The .env : 

- ***DEBUG=True*** ( during development ) False in Production.

- ***ALLOWED_HOSTS='PRODUCTION URL'***

- ***SECRET_KEY='SECRET KEY THAT COMES WITH THE INSTALL AND UPDATE IT DURING DEVELOPMENT AND THEN BEFORE DEPLOYING'*** 

- ***CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS='PRODUCTION URL ,http://localhost:5173'***

## Deployment 

Before deploying the application to Heroku, make sure `settings.py` is properly configured:

- Set `DEBUG = False`.
- Add production settings, including allowed hosts and database configurations.

Push changes to the main branch on GitHub, then follow these steps to deploy to Heroku using the website:

### Heroku Deployment

Heroku provides a platform for easy deployment and scaling of the application. 

1. **Create a Heroku App**
   - Go to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com).
   - Log in and create a new app.
   - Select your region and name your app.

2. **Connect the Heroku App to the GitHub Repository**
   - In the Heroku dashboard, go to the "Deploy" tab.
   - Under "Deployment method", select "GitHub".
   - Connect the GitHub account and search for the repository.
   - Click "Connect" to link the repository to the Heroku app.

3. **Configure Environment Variables**
   - Go to the "Settings" tab in the Heroku dashboard.
   - Click "Reveal Config Vars".
   - Add the necessary environment variables, including:
     - `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1` (required when using Cloudinary)
     - Other variables like `SECRET_KEY`, `DATABASE_URL`, etc.   

4. **Procfile Configuration**
   - The `Procfile` is in the root of the project directory. This file tells Heroku how to run the application. Add the following line to the `Procfile`:
     ```
     web: gunicorn backend.wsgi 
     ```
   5. **Deploy the Application**
   - In the Heroku dashboard, go to the "Deploy" tab.
   - Scroll down to the "Manual deploy" section.
   - Select the branch to deploy (usually `main`) and click "Deploy Branch".
   - Monitor the build process in the Heroku dashboard and check the build log for any errors.

6. **Post-Deployment**
   - Once the deployment is successful, the application will be live on the Heroku domain provided.
   - Monitor the applicationâ€™s performance and logs using the Heroku dashboard or the Heroku CLI.
